# JPMC_Case_Study
I have written a python code in Pytorch framework to recognize OCR Characters from noisy images.

- Preprocessing the images - A combination of dilation and erosion has been used to remove noise from images.
- 3 conventional machine learning methods have been compared in performance
- A new model based on Convolutional Neural Network has been designed for OCR detection
